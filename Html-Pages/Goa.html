        Goa is a favored tourist destination of people from around the world. 
        With its vast stretches of silvery beaches caressed by the sparkling blue Arabian Sea, this city offers its visitors a medley of old-world charm and modern sophistication. 
        The hidden coves of Goa offer an unexplored territory for the adventurer in you. Despite being the smallest state in India, Goa boasts a quality of life which is ranked No. 1 in the country. 
        Goa is home to two World Heritage sights, namely the Bom Jesus Basilica and the churches and convents of Old Goa. The city has a very vibrant nightlife, ranked 6th in the world. 
        Goa flaunts its Portuguese heritage in the many churches, temples, and mansions spread across the city. The Naval Aviation Museum, Fort Aguada, and the Wax Museum, showcasing the history, heritage and culture of India, are a few of the must-see attractions in Goa. 
        The tantalizing Goan cuisine, made with aromatic spices, is yet another draw to this beautiful city. A kaleidoscopic tropical paradise, there is nowhere else in India quite like Goa.
