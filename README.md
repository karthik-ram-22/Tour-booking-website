# Tour-booking-website

The workflow of the project after the download and setup of source code files

1)First, we land on the project's home page where we can see many tour descriptions and most importantly the sign-in link which directs us to the sign-in page when we click.

2)	 On the login page of the website, the user has to enter his/her credentials (username and password) to log in to the website. If the user is not registered, then he/she needs to register on the signup page with the credentials.  A facility to change the password has been provided if the user wants to change the password. Logging in with admin credentials will direct you to a page where the booking details of each user are available. If the user is idle for more than 10 seconds then the session automatically expires.

3)	At the booking page, the user has to enter his name, date of the trip, trip package, number of members for the trip, and other details and book a ticket by clicking on the book link which directs us to the payment page

4)	On the payment page, enter the details and the payment method after which we can book a trip. After booking, a confirmation mail will be sent to the registered email regarding the booking status.

5)	If the user has any complaints, feedback, or dissatisfaction regarding the tour, he can use the feedback and complaints form to provide the feedback and complaints. For the complaints, the user should upload a image file as a proof
